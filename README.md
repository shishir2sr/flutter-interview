Dear, project manager
Here I am showing my most recent work which is developing with extremely well known and most famous software design pattern 'Domain Driven Design (DDD)'. It is a technique for architecting software design by looking at software in top-down perspective. I have built clean, maintainable code and isolate the business logic from the design.
